## Launching EDA Learn, Your Community Hub for Event-Driven Architecture

We're excited to launch EDA Learn, a community-driven platform dedicated to making Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) more accessible and practical for developers, architects, and tech leaders.

### What We Offer

- **Playground Projects**: Hands-on, real-world examples that you can clone and run locally to experiment with different EDA patterns and practices
- **Blog Posts**: Regular insights from industry experts about EDA best practices, patterns, and emerging trends
- **Community Resources**: A curated collection of tools, frameworks, and learning materials

### Get Started

Visit our [Playground Projects](/projects/) to start experimenting with EDA implementations, from basic patterns to advanced scenarios like error handling and observability.

### Join Our Community

EDA Learn is built by the community, for the community. We welcome contributions in any form:

- Share your EDA experiences through blog posts

Let's learn and grow together in the world of Event-Driven Architecture!
