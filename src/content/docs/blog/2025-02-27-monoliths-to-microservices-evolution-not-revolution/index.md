ðŸ’¥ Monoliths aren't dying, they're evolving.
The journey from monolith to microservices isn't a migration.
It's a transformation that most companies get completely wrong.

Today's reality: Most enterprises are struggling with monoliths that have become impossible to change. Deployments take weeks, not minutes. One tiny change creates ripple effects across the entire codebase.

The knee-jerk reaction? "Let's break it into microservices!"

But here's what typically happens:

1. Teams arbitrarily slice the monolith based on the org chart
2. They create distributed microservices that still share a database
3. What was once a function call is now an HTTP request or message
4. The system gets slower and more complex, not better
5. Two years later, they've created a distributed monolith - the worst of both worlds

The present approach fails because it treats the problem as primarily technical when it's actually organizational and conceptual.

Where we're headed - the future of monolith decomposition:

Instead of starting with services, successful teams will start with events and domains.

1. Event Storming will become the standard first step, mapping the business process flows before writing any code

2. Bounded Contexts will be identified and respected, allowing different parts of the system to use models that make sense for their specific domain

3. Monoliths won't be deprecated, they'll be hollowed out - gradually moving functionality to services while maintaining the shell

4. Strangler Fig Pattern will be applied systematically, intercepting calls to the monolith and redirecting them to new services

5. Polyglot persistence will replace shared databases, with each service owning its data

6. Event-Driven Architecture will be the connective tissue, allowing loose coupling between services

7. Evolutionary Architecture practices will ensure systems can adapt to changing business needs

The transition won't happen overnight. 

The most successful organizations will maintain their monolith while strategically extracting functionality into domains and services that provide the most business value.

The end state won't be pure microservices for most organizations. It will be a pragmatic mix of service styles - some micro, some macro, some monolithic - all aligned with business domains and connected through well-defined interfaces and events.

So in short, breaking monoliths isn't about making everything smaller - it's about aligning technical architecture with business domains.

The future belongs to organizations that can evolve their monoliths intelligently, not those trying to force-fit microservices everywhere.

The key isn't the size but the clarity of the boundaries between services and how well they represent the business reality.
